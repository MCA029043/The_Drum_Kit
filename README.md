# Drum Kit Web Application

The Drum Kit Web Application is a simple interactive web page that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on virtual drum buttons. Each button corresponds to a different drum sound, and the sounds are played back when the buttons are clicked. This application is a fun way to create your own beats and rhythms right in your web browser!
